This means that we get to take our annual look at coordinators who could make the leap to become head coaches, and the teams who are likely to poach them.<br /><br /><b> The prime candidates identified by our experts are: </b><br />Nicholas Kinsey - Defensive Coordinator - Green Bay Packers<br />Larry Good - Defensive Coordinator - San Francisco 49ers<br />Alvin Blythe - Defensive Coordinator - St. Louis Cardinals<br />Ronald Forte - Defensive Coordinator - San Diego Chargers<br />Bill Hubbard - Offensive Coordinator - Cleveland Browns<br />Robert Wilder - Offensive Coordinator - San Francisco 49ers<br />Willie Luong - Offensive Coordinator - San Diego Chargers<br />Alexander Gibson - Defensive Coordinator - Oakland Raiders<br /><br />As always, we are prone to wild speculations, so we asked our in-house experts to do a little matchmaking between candidates and teams. Here is what they came up with:<br /><br /><b>Mary Moore</b>: <br />I see Larry Good being promoted to head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.<br /><br /><b>Darren Francis</b>: <br />I think the Browns lose Bill Hubbard and I see him heading to San Francisco 49ers.<br /><br /><b>Jim Nox</b>: <br />The Chargers cannot hold on to Ronald Forte. I would like to see him coach the San Francisco 49ers.<br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper</b>: <br />Alexander Gibson is certainly on the move. That means Raiders will need a new coordinator. As for where Gibson ends up? Well, I think San Francisco 49ers is a good bet.</h3><h2>Contract Updates</h2><h3>The following players have unlocked bonuses in their contracts based on their performance last season:<br />Dick Felt
