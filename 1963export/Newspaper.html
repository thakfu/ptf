McCain will continue to serve as Head Coach for 3 years earning 4 million pr year.</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Cleveland Browns at Philadelphia Eagles</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Philadelphia Eagles</b><br />This defense is likely to step up this week. They are 2nd in the league pass average yards per rush. They are 4th in forced fumbles. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Cleveland Browns</b><br />Head coach Wilbur Crum has this team running like a well oiled machine. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Philadelphia Eagles</b><br />Really this could go either way, but you will never get me to admit it. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Philadelphia Eagles</b><br />Look for them to continue their winstreak. <br /></h3><h2>No Pass Zone in Green Bay.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/21.png'>Packers pass defense this year has been blistering this season, giving up only 2209 in 13 games. Said one member of the defensive backfield, ‘It’s like blood in the water when that ball goes in the air. We all turn into sharks. The scary kind, that jump outta the water and stuff.’.</h3><h2>Green Bay Packers defense dominates!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/21.png'>The Packers' defense is showing how it is done this season. In 13 games they’ve allowed only 2992 total yards and 139 points. Bill Forester - LB is the anchor of the defense with 79 tackles on the year. Could the D be back in Green Bay?</h3><h2>Week 15: SS Willie Wood (GB) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/21.png'>SS Willie Wood of the Green Bay Packers has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

Wilder will continue to serve as Offensive Coordinator for 2 years earning 5 million pr year.</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Green Bay Packers at Chicago Bears</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Chicago Bears</b><br />For this game, certainly, you have to think that Bears got to love fielding Bill George - LB on their defense. This man will be critical this week, and will give the offense plenty of trouble. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Green Bay Packers</b><br />This will be watercooler talk on monday. Do not miss it. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Chicago Bears</b><br />They field one of the most underestimated offenses. They are 3rd in the league in sacks allowed. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Chicago Bears</b><br />For this game, my gut tells me that you cannot keep Ronnie Bull - RB down for an entire game. Eventually he will come out of the blue and make a big play. A double digit win. <br /></h3><h2>Trouble for Los Angeles Rams.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/35.png'>Pressure is mounting in Los Angeles owing to their 3-9-0 record this season.

The Lions players had expected an easy victory, and this will be a bitter loss and a tough blow to the self-respect of the program. Meanwhile the Vikings fans are ecstatic and are already entertaining thoughts about a cinderella future.</h3><h2>Week 14: QB George Blanda (Hou) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/38.png'>The league announced Houston Oilers quarterback George Blanda has been named Offensive Player of the Week.<br /><br />    The Oilers defeated the Denver Broncos, 52 to 31. Blanda did his part, throwing 4 touchdowns, completing 29 of 34 passes for 345 yards. His outstanding performance now brings his season Touchdown to Interception Ratio to 20 to 4, and a passer rating of 113.2.</h3><h2>Coach Showdown with Simon Sly (Season 1963 Week 15)</h2><h3>Simon Sly is back with this week's edition of Coach Showdown. Let us jump right in.<br /><br />WILLIE MORGAN, OFFENSIVE COORDINATOR, WASHINGTON REDSKINS<br />The Redskins currently sit at 4-8.<br /><br />Willie Morgan wants to be aggressive on offense. He loves football, and it shows that this is his dreamjob. His eagerness to discuss all aspects of the game is infectious in an organisation. <br />Willie Morgan runs a run first Power offense. He runs mostly from power formations. It's about taking what the defense gives you in the passing game, according to Morgan. His offense relies on big wide receivers. <br /><br />They are 7th in the league pass completion percentage. They are 13th in the league passing touchdowns with 18. They are 19th in the league passing yards per game.

Here is what they came up with:<br /><br /><b>Mary Moore</b>: <br />Jerome Stevens leaves the Browns to become the head coach for the Los Angeles Rams.<br /><br /><b>Darren Francis</b>: <br />I think the Packers lose Nicholas Kinsey and I see him heading to Washington Redskins.<br /><br /><b>Jim Nox</b>: <br />The Rams cannot hold on to Carlos Deloach. I would like to see him coach the Pittsburgh Steelers.<br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper</b>: <br />Carlos Deloach is certainly on the move. That means Rams will need a new coordinator. As for where Deloach ends up? Well, I think Washington Redskins is a good bet.</h3><h2>Contract Updates</h2><h3>The following players have unlocked bonuses in their contracts based on their performance last season:<br />Jimmy Carr - FS (Philadelphia Eagles) unlocked a 10% bonus for Tackles (Target: 40 / Accomplished: 45).<br />Charlie Scales - RB (Cleveland Browns) unlocked a 10% bonus for winning the championship.<br />Dick Lynch - FS (New York Giants) unlocked a 5% bonus for Tackles (Target: 40 / Accomplished: 56).<br />Richard Bagley - WR (New York Giants) unlocked a 5% bonus for Catches (Target: 40 / Accomplished: 44).<br />John Brown - T (New York Giants) unlocked a 10% bonus for Games Started (Target: 8 / Accomplished: 12).<br />Charlie Bradshaw - T (Pittsburgh Steelers) unlocked a 10% bonus for Pancakes (Target: 20 / Accomplished: 40).<br />Clendon Thomas - CB (Pittsburgh Steelers) unlocked a 5% bonus for Tackles (Target: 40 / Accomplished: 78).<br />Jim Kerr - FS (Washington Redskins) unlocked a 5% bonus for Tackles (Target: 40 / Accomplished: 55).<br />Dan LaRose - T (Detroit Lions) unlocked a 5% bonus for Pancakes (Target: 20 / Accomplished: 23).<br />Dick Compton - WR (Detroit Lions) unlocked a 10% bonus for Games Started (Target: 8 / Accomplished: 10).<br />Bob Kilcullen - DT (Chicago Bears) unlocked a 10% bonus for Games Started (Target: 8 / Accomplished: 12).<br />Charley Cowan - T (Los Angeles Rams) unlocked a 10% bonus for Games Started (Target: 8 / Accomplished: 14).<br />Jimmy Saxton - RB (Los Angeles Rams) unlocked a 10% bonus for Avg.
