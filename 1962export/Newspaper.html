You look at guys like Gene Hickerson - G and what he does for a team. Leadership like that helps you win games. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : New York Giants</b><br />They field one of the most underestimated offenses. They will rack up a lot of points. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : New York Giants</b><br />Last game was a fluke. They will win again this week. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Cleveland Browns</b><br />I do not think you get very far against their defense. They are 1st in sacks with 57. They are 3rd in points allowed, averaging only 14.2. They are 5th in pass defense. They only give up 214.8 per game. They are 1st in interceptions with 18. They are 1st in the league pass average yards per rush. This game will be so very entertaining. <br /></h3><h2>San Francisco 49ers upset the Los Angeles Rams!</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/29.png'>The San Francisco 49ers fans are celebrating after the 49ers took down the Los Angeles Rams.<br />In a superb effort the 49ers kept at it, and brought home the win.

Having a guy like Gene Hickerson - G on the field and in the locker room is exactly what you need to win games like this. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : New York Giants</b><br />I may be biased here, but I think the Giants are obviously the better team. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : New York Giants</b><br />Boy, oh boy am I looking forward to this. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Cleveland Browns</b><br />For this game, the film shows that Bob Gain - DT is the guy to watch. His paycheck alone should give that away. He will be great to watch. But it will be a close game. <br /></h3><h2>No Pass Zone in Detroit.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/23.png'>Lions pass defense this year has been terrific this season, giving up only 1955 in 12 games.

If you look at the game, you will see some players just are not delivering.' said the Titans LB. Asked to clarify, Grantham suggested Mike Hudock - C needs to perform better, but underscored that there was plenty of blame to go around. 'Guys need to listen, we need to get grinding, you cannot just show up and expect to play or expect to win', Grantham concluded.</h3><h2>Week 14: LB Mike Stratton (Buf) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>LB Mike Stratton of the Buffalo Bills has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award.

I'm Simon Sly. Let us jump right in.<br /><br />ALEXANDER GIBSON, DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, OAKLAND RAIDERS<br />The Raiders currently sit at 2-10.<br /><br />Alexander Gibson does not like gambling on defense. Advocating a bend, but don't break mindset. His attitude is relaxed, and he is good at making everyone around him feel comfortable and promotes a friendly and unceremonial atmosphere in the organisation. <br />Alexander Gibson runs a 3-4 Hybrid defense. His system requires top notch cornerbacks. He prefers mixing up coverage. The defensive line's primary role is rushing the passer. He wants fast linebackers, who can help in coverage. <br /><br />They are 16th in sacks with 24.<br />They are 22nd in points allowed, averaging 33.5.<br />They are 22nd in pass defense with 302.8 yards given up per game.<br />They are 20th in run defense. Giving up 132.4 yards per game.<br />They are 13th in interceptions with 9.<br />They are 9th in the league in tackles for loss.<br />They are 22nd in forced fumbles.<br /><br />Gibson is slightly better than Good at estimating player potential.<br /><br /><br />LARRY GOOD, DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS<br />The 49ers currently sit at 3-9.<br /><br />Larry Good favors an aggressive defense.
