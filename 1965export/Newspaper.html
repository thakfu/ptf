Big names make big plays in big games, I cannot wait to watch this. This will be a great game to watch. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Kansas City Chiefs</b><br />Look for their defense to dominate. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : San Diego Chargers</b><br />For this game, it seems clear that there is this DE named Earl Faison. He is getting paid a lot. The reason he is getting paid a lot is that he is really good. Do I need to say more?<br /></h3><h2>Defense dominates in San Francisco.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/29.png'>The 49ers front four is beating up the men on the other side of the ball so far this season with a total of 14 sacks, 1 forced fumbles and 93 tackles in 14 games.</h3><h2>Baird media buzz</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/35.png'>The local media seems to have picked their newest fancy: Bill Baird - CB. Bill Baird - CB is everywhere in the Los Angeles media. Dealing with interview requests and evaluating endorsement deals threatens to detract from his play on the field. Seeing how Baird navigates this surging media attention will be an interesting story to follow. As for the team, the Rams are sure to be enjoying his time in the spotlight, as their PR department is having their jobs done for them.</h3><h2>Week 15: RB Wendell Hayes (Phi) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/17.png'>The honor comes after Hayes's 18 att, 170 yds, 1 TD performance against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Hayes from Humboldt State was selected in round 2, 2 years ago.<br /><br />    Hayes now has 708 Rushing Yards and 2 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Week 15: FS Paul Moon (LA) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/35.png'>FS Moon's ball hawking ability was on display in the Rams 41-17 game with the St. Louis Cardinals.

They are 5th in the league passing touchdowns with 29. They are 3rd in the league points scored per game. They average 29.7! <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Los Angeles Rams</b><br />Looking at the two rosters, my line of thinking is that Eddie Meador - FS will drive the offense crazy. And you can take that with you to the bank. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : St. Louis Cardinals</b><br />The leadership on this team is great. Having a guy like Larry Wilson - CB on the field and in the locker room is exactly what you need to win games like this. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : St. Louis Cardinals</b><br />Looking at the teams, my money would be on that Brice Paterson - LB is bound to have an impact. The offense will have to gameplan for him if they want to stand even the slightest chance. Easy prediction. <br /></h3><h2>Week 14: LB Brice Paterson (StL) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/36.png'>LB Paterson absolutely dominated in the Cardinals 38-36 game with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Here is what they came up with:<br /><br /><b>Mary Moore</b>: <br />I see Larry Good being promoted to head coach of the San Francisco 49ers.<br /><br /><b>Darren Francis</b>: <br />I think the Browns lose Bill Hubbard and I see him heading to San Francisco 49ers.<br /><br /><b>Jim Nox</b>: <br />The Chargers cannot hold on to Ronald Forte. I would like to see him coach the San Francisco 49ers.<br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper</b>: <br />Alexander Gibson is certainly on the move. That means Raiders will need a new coordinator. As for where Gibson ends up? Well, I think San Francisco 49ers is a good bet.</h3><h2>Contract Updates</h2><h3>The following players have unlocked bonuses in their contracts based on their performance last season:<br />Dick Felt
