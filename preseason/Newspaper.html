They are 4th in points allowed, averaging only 17.4. They are 5th in interceptions with 5. They are 3rd in the league pass average yards per rush. This will really be a statement win. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Cincinnati Bengals</b><br />Of course the Bengals win. Have you been living under a rock? This will be a great game to watch. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Oakland Raiders</b><br />I think having a leader like Ronnie Lott - FS is the kind of thing that will help the Raiders win this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Cincinnati Bengals</b><br />This will either be wildly entertaining or a dull grind. I see no middle between the two. <br /></h3><h2>Top receiver trio?</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/3.png'>The Oilers trio of Roy Green - WR, Mike Quick - WR and Leo Lewis - WR are currently the leading trio of catchers in the league, with 987 receiving yards between the three.</h3><h2>Wright blasts Bill Bryan - C in wake of Bills loss.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>Louis Wright was furious with his team in an interview after the Bills lost. He called out the effort on both offense and defense. 'These guys, they do not seem hungry. We have to get on the same page. Are we doing this or not?', he complained. Louis Wright - CB was clearly upset after the Bills loss. 'We need to look at ourselves. If you are Bill Bryan (C), can you look at your performance and be happy? This whole team needs to work harder. This whole team needs to decide what we want', the CB said.</h3><h2>Week 5: FS Michael Downs (PRO) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/8.png'>FS Michael Downs of the Providence Steam Rollers has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. Downs finished with 4 Tck, 2 Int, 1 Def TD.</h3><h2>Week 5: RB Marcus Allen (KC) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>Week 5's Offensive Player of the Week is Running Back Marcus Allen. His 28 att, 162 yds, 2 TD performance stood out in the 41 to 7 victory for the Kansas City Chiefs.<br /><br />    The former USC gridiron star is racking up the rushing yards and now has 630 Yards and 5 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 5</h2><h3>Steam Rollers - 27, Bills - 6<br />      Monarchs - 34, Blue Bombers - 7<br />      Raiders - 24, Dolphins - 21<br />      Oilers - 34, Panthers - 28<br />      49ers - 45, Packers - 6<br />      Vikings - 23, Eagles - 20<br />      [Redacted]s - 27, Lions - 21<br />      Chiefs - 41, Falcons - 7<br />      Bengals - 34, Bears - 16</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Miami Dolphins at Oakland Raiders</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Miami Dolphins</b><br />You just have to look at their offense. They are 4th in the league pass completion percentage. They are 2nd in the league passing touchdowns with 10. They are 1st in the league passing yards per game. They average 319.2! They are 1st in the league in sacks allowed. They are 2nd in the league rushing touchdowns with 6. They are 1st in the league points scored per game. They average 31.2! Believe me. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Oakland Raiders</b><br />I am really on the fence for this one, but I stand my prediction. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Oakland Raiders</b><br />Do not sleep on this defense. They are 1st in sacks with 16. They are 2nd in points allowed, averaging only 12.8. They are 2nd in interceptions with 4. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Oakland Raiders</b><br />Head coach Ross Tirona does a great job getting them prepared every week. This week will be no different. He is doing some clever things with his defense. <br /></h3><h2>Coach Showdown with Simon Sly (Season 1985 Week 5)</h2><h3>Simon Sly is here to bring you another edition of Coach Showdown. This week features two interesting specimens.<br /><br />MARV LEVY, HEAD COACH, BUFFALO BILLS<br />The Bills currently sit at 0-4.<br /><br />Marv Levy preaches flexibility on both offense and defense, focusing on what the situation demands. He loves football, and it shows that this is his dreamjob. His eagerness to discuss all aspects of the game is infectious in an organisation. <br /><br />Levy is much more charismatic than Seifert.<br />Levy outperforms Seifert in player development.<br />Levy is not as rigid as Seifert.<br />Levy works with young players somewhat better than Seifert.<br /><br /><br />GEORGE SEIFERT, HEAD COACH, LONDON MONARCHS<br />The Monarchs currently sit at 2-2.<br /><br />George Seifert preaches flexibility on both offense and defense, focusing on what the situation demands. He is serious and unrelenting, asserts his authority and has little tolerance for distractions. <br /><br />Seifert is slightly more detail oriented than Levy.<br />Seifert is a better offisive mind than Levy.<br />Seifert is so much smarter than Levy.<br />Seifert is better suited to lead a team than Levy.<br />Seifert motivates his team a little better than Levy.<br /></h3><h2>Perry media buzz</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/12.png'>Turns out Detroit local media have jumped on the William Perry hypetrain. The media presense of William Perry - DT is really taking off. His recent interviews have gathered a lot of viewers, and the Lions are enjoying a surge in media coverage and requests. Most people expect Perry to leverage his newfound media following into endorsement deals and possibly a new contract with the Lions.</h3><h2>Week 4: DE Chris Doleman (GB) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/10.png'>DE Doleman absolutely dominated in the Packers 26-20 game with the Buffalo Bills. He finished with 5 Tck, 2 Sck, 1 FF, 1 FR.</h3><h2>Week 4: RB James Wilder (CLM) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/18.png'>The honor comes after Wilder's 30 att, 197 yds, 2 TD performance against the San Francisco 49ers. Wilder from Missouri was selected in round 3, 0 years ago.<br /><br />    Wilder now has 519 Rushing Yards and 3 Touchdowns for the season.</h3><h2>Johnny Rembert responds to Pete Holohan.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/15.png'>'We aint taking no bait! What does he think we are? Trout?' Johnny Rembert responded when asked about the gloating of Pete Holohan after their recent game. 'Our focus is football, not silly childrens games' continued the LB. This should put immediate worries about loss of focus in the 49ers locker room to rest, and is a suitable display of professionality. Well done.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 4</h2><h3>Dolphins - 30, Falcons - 24<br />      Monarchs - 26, Bears - 7<br />      Panthers - 30, 49ers - 17<br />      Eagles - 40, [Redacted]s - 10<br />      Packers - 26, Bills - 20<br />      Raiders - 10, Blue Bombers - 7<br />      Oilers - 31, Steam Rollers - 17<br />      Vikings - 35, Bengals - 10<br />      Chiefs - 34, Lions - 27</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Cincinnati Bengals at Minnesota Vikings</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Minnesota Vikings</b><br />Team play. Playing as a unit. You cannot discount the difference it makes. I am thinking of a guy like Randall Cunningham - QB. Playing as a team is what gets them the win. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Minnesota Vikings</b><br />I love what they are doing in Minnesota coaching-wise. Head coach Brock Lesnar is a major reason they will win this game. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Minnesota Vikings</b><br />The leadership on this team is great. Having a guy like Randall Cunningham - QB on the field and in the locker room is exactly what you need to win games like this. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Cincinnati Bengals</b><br />You just have to look at their defense. They are 2nd in points allowed, averaging only 12. They are 4th in pass defense. They only give up 165 per game. They are 4th in run defense. Giving up only 99.3 yards per game. They are 5th in interceptions with 3. <br /></h3><h2>Randy White optimistic about the future.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>Randy White was not pessimistic in an interview after the Bills lost to the Monarchs. Randy White - DT was upbeat in his assessment after the London lost a close game to the White. 'We learned a lot. We showed a lot. There is reason for optimism. We are very close, and we keep building every week. Do not switch channels, we will be with you shortly.', London said smiling confidently.</h3><h2>Week 3: QB Randall Cunningham (MIN) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/13.png'>The Minnesota Vikings' Randall Cunningham threw 1 touchdowns, completing 20 of 24 passes for 146 yards in the Vikings victory over the Atlanta Falcons.<br /><br />    After being drafted in Round 1 of the 1985 amateur draft, season number 0 for Cunningham, has seen some impressive numbers including 5 touchdown passes this season.</h3><h2>Week 3: DE Reggie White (BUF) wins Defensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/5.png'>DE Reggie White of the Buffalo Bills has earned the Defensive Player of the Week award. White finished with 6 Tck, 5 Sck, 1 FF.</h3><h2>Game Recaps for Week 3</h2><h3>Bengals - 15, Blue Bombers - 14<br />      Raiders - 24, Chiefs - 23<br />      Vikings - 38, Falcons - 35<br />      49ers - 30, Eagles - 21<br />      Packers - 27, Lions - 24<br />      Dolphins - 37, Steam Rollers - 30<br />      Panthers - 16, Bears - 13<br />      Oilers - 34, [Redacted]s - 3<br />      Monarchs - 22, Bills - 20</h3><h2>Game of the Week: Cincinnati Bengals at Winnipeg Blue Bombers</h2><h3>Our Expert Predictions: <br /><br /><b>Jeremy Piper : Cincinnati Bengals</b><br />When you think of the players that will be on the field, you can make the argument that Dan Marino - QB will shine for the Bengals offense. They rely on him, and he will deliver. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Cincinnati Bengals</b><br />Looking at the teams, it is likely that Steve McMichael - DT is the guy to watch, this man is pivotal to the Bengals defense. The referees will have their work cut out for them. This will be very competitive and intense. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Winnipeg Blue Bombers</b><br />I think their defense will carry them. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Cincinnati Bengals</b><br />The leadership on this team is great. Having a guy like Dan Marino - QB on the field and in the locker room is exactly what you need to win games like this. They get their win and this game will be just another day at the office. <br /></h3><h2>Pete Holohan ridicules the 49ers.</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/11.png'>No mincing of words from Pete Holohan after the Bears beat the 49ers. 'I think we were clearly the better team. You know, the 49ers talk a big game, but then this game gave context to that.</h3><h2>Coach Showdown with Simon Sly (Season 1985 Week 3)</h2><h3>Simon Sly is back with this week's edition of Coach Showdown. This week features two interesting specimens.<br /><br />DICK MODZELEWSKI, DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR, GREEN BAY PACKERS<br />The Packers currently sit at 1-1.<br /><br />Dick Modzelewski favors an aggressive defense. Professionalism is the key for him. He demands accountability from everyone around him. <br />Dick Modzelewski runs a 4-3 Hybrid defense. The defense revolves around the linebackers.

Have you been living under a rock? A double digit win. <br /><br /><b>Mary Moore : Minnesota Vikings</b><br />When you think of the players that will be on the field, I think that the Vikings' defense goes through Karl Mecklenburg - LB. This man has the ability to change games. Lots of points scored. <br /><br /><b>Jim Nox : Minnesota Vikings</b><br />I think having a team players like Randall Cunningham - QB is the kind of thing that will help the Vikings win this game. <br /><br /><b>Darren Francis : Detroit Lions</b><br />They will get another win this week. <br /></h3><h2>Week 1: RB Marcus Allen (KC) wins Offensive Player of the Week</h2><h3><img class="TeamImg" src='Images/Logos/1.png'>The honor comes after Allen's 31 att, 174 yds, 1 TD performance against the Houston Oilers.
