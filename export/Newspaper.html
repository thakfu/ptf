He is sure to produce some highlight reel takedowns in his career. Has sufficient strength to play with the big boys in the pros. Will never become a speed rush specialist, but has sufficient speed to become a prototype Defensive End. Blue-chip player. Exactly what they look for. Add a young talent to a roster thin at the position, a great fit. <br /><br /></h3><h2>Offseason Team Needs with Jeremy Piper</h2><h3>With a new offseason under way, some rosters are in good shape.
